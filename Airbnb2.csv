It's easy to rent with me. Like having your family flat for your personal use!","This residence is limited to TWO people and is for a MINIMUM rental of SIX MONTHS.","2009-07-29","I am a Native New Yorker (yes, I was born and raised here!) and have lived in Boston, Paris and Los Angeles and speak a bit of French and Spanish and about two words of Italian. I work in the legal field. I went to culinary school to study pastry many years ago and now I just bake cookies at Christmas when I have the time!

I have traveled to over 60 countries, go away to my house in Pennsylvania on many weekends and like meeting new people. 

As to the listings on AIRBNB: I have one ""Supersize Studio"" on the Upper East Side, which is a walk-up and has no doorman and I do not live there. The building is approximately 50 years old. The entire apartment is at your disposal. There is a queen sized bed, a table and chairs and it is perfect for a sole occupant needing a home-away-from-home. It is in Yorkville, home of the old Austrian and Hungarian and German bakeries, long gone. On Saturdays, at Saint Stephen's, which is opposite the apartment, there is a market which is wonderful. Otherwise, you have more than enough small cute places  to eat and hang out and if you are a couple of young single people, all the bars and restaurants you might want to go to until closing are on Second Avenue, one block over. This apartment is a very large studio with high ceilings and faces north to a garden, which is quiet. It comes with linens and dishes and has a small kitchen. There is a $60 cleaning fee and a $500security deposit required. AIRBNB collects the security and I ask you pre-pay the cleaning fee on arrival in cash.

So as to avoid confusion, the second listing, ""Paris in New York"" location is my home and about which I speak below and this is the apartment which has been reviewed the most. I no longer allow it to be rented.

I traveled to Europe the first time on my own via SERVAS many years ago and have not forgotten the kindness of the people I met then. I hope to reciprocate and make new friends!

Please contact me if you are interested in staying at one of my places. You MUST be a non-smoker but smoking is allowed in front of the building outside if you are desperate.

Please have your profile here. It is easier if I know  something about who you are, where you live and what you do. If I don't know something about you, it's hard for me to answer a request to stay quickly, since I like to have a level of comfort renting.

I've known one friend who lives in Abu Dhabi who I met via SERVAS over 30 years now. I expect to know my AirBNB guests just as long!

Thanks for your interest!

As to the other listings: the apartment in Paris (Chatelet) is not available again until 2015.  It is rented a minimum of six months. The apartment in Hossegor, in the Southwest of France, is available off-season each year from October until May. 

The Victorian house in northeast Pennsylvania is available on select weeks if you are interested in skiing at Elk Mountain, which is 20 minutes up the hill on Route 106 from Carbondale.

Just ask me!

I'm 38 and I've been living in Paris for more than a decade now. I was born and raised in the south of France, in and around Nice. Travelwise, I am a big fan of Taiwan, where I have made great friends in recent years. My main job is acting, and I also work in dubbing for cinema. Voilà, c'est moi! 

I bought this little studio from a friend this year. He completely renovated not long before I bought it, with a view to offering a great, bright and cosy spot for visiting friends and other guests. It's been very popular since the first few days we started advertising it!

If this is the first time you're considering booking an apartment, you should be glad: you're about to discover how much better than a hotel it is! Staying in a self-catered apartment you get a better feel of the city, really. Shopping for food at the nearby market to prepare good meals with fresh local produce instead dining out all the time makes it feel much more like home. Having a pad where you can invite people over is also a great plus.

I hope you'll have a great time here. And if Parisians look grumpy, don't worry, it's just they're being like everyone else. When you smile at them and apologize for not speaking French (which IS a crime), they usually melt and are the friendliest people you'll meet (almost).

I'm really enjoying sharing my knowledge and experiences of the city through the many wonderful people who've stayed as my guests through Airbnb - what a fantastic concept it is. I take much pleasure in making sure anyone staying with me has a great experience and stay and have a very professional approach in the preparation and presentation of my apartment.

This apartment used to be my home in the city, and although I've moved now, I've taken a lot of care and paid a lot of attention in re-decorating and equipping it to make it the perfect pad from which to explore Paris...
If you've got any questions or need any help while planning your trip to Paris I'd be very happy to lend a helping hand.

Looking forward to hopefully meeting you and welcoming you to Paris...!

I was born in Paris 38 years ago (not so easy to find a Paris native in Paris!) and grew up in a milieu where French art de vivre is key. 
I love Paris, where I have my habit but  where I always keep room for surprise. 
I’m the one, friends have always kept calling asking « where could I take my parents for dinner » « what would you suggest for an anniversary  », « It’s so sunny today, where can we have a brunch ?
Just  like you…
I love travelling, discovering new parts, going out to concerts, movies, exhibitions, partying or spending quiet times with family and friends by the fire place in a sunny park .
I love good food, good wine, and I feel truly sorry when I see disoriented tourists sitting in a tourist trap where I wouldn’t go even if paid.
I decided it was time ! 
After studying in HEC management school and working for 10 years in big advertising agencies, I left the top management position I had achieved, deciding  that it was time that I launched my own business, make something that I really liked. That's how I founded my own business, with this ambitious project of making you experience Paris like only a Parisian can. 
Looking forward to seeing you in Paris ! :)

The Paris studio flat is mine and I truly love it so please take good care of it: Each guest receives a very detailed set of ""House Rules"" and I make a quite candid disclosure of the the fact that there is no elevator, so far no curtains, that cannot flush things in the WC, etc. ...

J'aime beaucoup le cinéma. Chez nous à Paris il y a un Home Cinéma et beaucoup de films. Notre cuisine donne sur le Louxor, le plus ancien cinéma de Paris, qui vient d'être rénové.

A Tanger c'est la maison de ma mère... il y a aussi un home cinéma, mais c'est surtout la vue qui est remarquable, la baie de Tanger et l'Espagne. C'est une grande maison habitée et chaleureuse, où l'on se sent bien.

I work from home and love it - the time goes so quickly!

And after having worked in hotels many years ago, I was almost surprised to enjoy looking after our guests - I thought it might become repetitive and boring, but every person is different, and we're lucky enough to have so really adorable people come to stay, so it's a joy to rent the apartment! If I didn't love it, I wouldn't do it.

You have a choice of metro line 12, line 7 and line 2.

No smoking inside (sorry!) though it's ok on the balcony. Please secure the bedroom shutters -- either open or closed -- when you leave. Please take just the sheets and the top pillowcases off the bed at the end of your stay, and throw away any food you haven't used from the fridge. Please open the window in the WC to air the bathroom after taking a shower. Please be gentle with the double doors that open onto the balcony in the living room - one side is a bit stiff but opens ok if you are patient with it! If it proves tricky to close, just lift slightly at the same time. Thanks! There is a key for taking the garbage downstairs if you want to empty the bin. Fyi a cleaner comes once a week. Have a nice stay!","2012-04-10","I've been living in France for 12 years now and this is a great arrondissement -  I hope you love it as much as i do.

It will get you to Châtelet, the very heart of Paris in just 10min. Trains are running every 2 or 3min. If you take a look at the Paris metro map, you will see that ligne 11 has many connections to other useful lignes that will take you easily to any place in the city. For example ligne 2 straight to the Champs Elysées, ligne four to the west bank... You can also use a convenient bus, number 26. There is a stop named JOURDAIN just one minute walk from our place at ""rue des Pyrénées"". Now, don't forget Paris is not such a big city... In my opinion the best way to discover it is by walking. For example, it will take you just 30min walk from our place to the famous art museum Centre George Pompidou. Paris can actually be crossed by foot in one hour from north to south, and in tow hours walk from east to west. Finally the is a bike renting station just down the street.","You can use and enjoy the whole apartment.","We do live in our apartment and take care of it daily to make it nice and cosy for us.  So we hope it will be also for you, a real home. If you are looking for an anonymous professional Airbnb apartment, this is not the wright place... For us, the spirit of leting our home is to get in touch with people and share with them this beautiful place we are so lucky to have. We made many nice meeting with interesting people all around the world. When we travel, we are mostly hosted by Airbnb getting to discover that way to the real local ways of living in our destinations.","First of all, please leav the appartement as clean as you have found it.

There's no lift, only stairs, but that's easy exercise (a flat-sitter will welcome you and help out with the luggage). It's a duplex of 70m2 (750 sq ft) with three bedrooms, one bathroom (with bath tub and shower), one toilet, a kitchen, dining space and living room.  The flat sleeps 6 adults. -The Kids room has bunk beds (90x190cm each).  -The Parents room has a 160x200cm bed.  -The Guest room/Play room has twin beds (80x190cm each, foam mattresses).

Familie","Just a few locks away there are 3 metro stops (12-jules joffrin / 4-pte de clignancourt / 13-guy moquet) and 7 bus lines that can take you anywhere in Paris, including Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, Saint-Lazare and Montparnasse, the Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysées, Musée du Louvre, and many more...!  We're also easy to find by cab from both airports since we're close to the 'periphérique'.","Guests will have access to the whole flat, all kitchen equipment (dishes, coffee machine, kettle, dishwasher, microwave...), washing machine, high speed wifi... We do not have a TV but if need be we can provide guest with credentials to watch French TV on your computer. You will also have access to an iron, plug adaptors, a scale, and a hair dryer. We usually try and leave enough for a first breakfast : tea, coffee, chocolate, jam and cereals.","We are French, and my wife and I speak English (she's a translator) and understand Spanish and Italian. We are happy to answer all questions before booking and provide all the instructions and tips to 'navigate' from any airport/station to our place. Check-ins and check-outs are made easy for you, we have nice neighbors who are always willing to help out! You can reach us easily at all times by phone, text or email.","We have moved around too and know how a travel schedule is not always easy to stick to. So we try and make arrangements that fit your plans but then we expect guests to be reachable at all times, especially around check-in time. Obviously we expect guests to respect the neighbors and the appartment (no pets nor smoking).","2011-07-09","We're a family of 4 proud Parisians ! I'm from Nice and my wife is from Paris.

Originally from Denmark, I have lived in Paris since 2000. I have a French husband and three boys. Paris is a fantastic city to live in, and I love my neighborhood and French culture.

I was educated as an architect, now I work with digital design. Besides, I am renting out two studios situated on the 1st floor above our own place. We live in a long typical Parisian courtyard, where residents live side by side with small business, mostly architects, designers and artists.

I have over fifteen years of experience in renting short term, and so far it has been a great experience. I enjoy meeting people from all over the world and sharing my knowledge of the local area as well as Paris in general. 

I look forward to welcoming you in Paris.

I love Paris and like to rediscover it permanently, its restaurants and bars, its photographs and painting gallery, its small path with its very specific architecture. . 
Beside that said, I am currently observing it through the website : (Website hidden by Airbnb) 
I am now so trying to provide a beautiful Paris experience to travellers through my very atypic loft which i have rejunevated with one thing in mind: How could i make people feeling good in it.
Seems to work pretty well, i will so be pleased to received whenever you would like!
Kind regards

Strange to me (specially about the mineral water) but allowed...  Welcome to the Old Good Paris ! :-)

I originally came on Airbnb to help my mom rent our family cottage house in Normandy. I loved the Airbnb experience, including when I tried it as a guest. So it was only natural that when I moved to live in Hong Kong I decided to rent my Parisian flat on Airbnb. I live back in it when I return to Paris.

I am a professional photographer. You can see my photos online by searching ""Pictobank"" on the Internet.

I love meeting people of all around the world.

Bonjour,

Je suis venu sur Airbnb d'abord pour aider ma mère à louer notre chaumière de famille en Normandie. J'ai beaucoup aimé mon expérience Airbnb, y compris quand je l'ai essayée en tant que voyageur. C'est donc tout naturellement que quand j'ai déménagé à Hong Kong pour y vivre, j'ai listé mon appartement sur Airbnb. J'y habite moi-même souvent quand je retourne à Paris.

Je suis photographe professionnel. Vous pouvez voir mes photos sur mon portfolio en cherchant ""Pictobank"" sur Internet.

J'aime rencontrer des gens de tous les pays.

I'm Alysa, an American who's called Paris home for more than a decade.  I've traveled a lot, especially in Europe and the US, but the City of Light is my favorite place in the world, and I love welcoming people here.  

I'm a writer, travel planner, and cat person, among other things.  Besides my family, what I love most in the world are: books, travel, museums, history, hypocritically critiquing celebrity fashion, and cookies.

Like my friend and neighbor Nathalie, I want you to feel welcome, comfortable, and even inspired in our charming studio.   And as someone passionate about Paris, I'm always ready with tips on what to see (from the ""musts"" to the offbeat), great local places to eat and shop, and more.

Bonjour!  Je suis Alysa, une américaine qui vit à Paris depuis une bonne dizaine d’années.  J’ai beaucoup voyagé, surtout en Europe et aux Etats-Unis, mais la Ville Lumière est mon endroit préféré au monde.
 
Je suis écrivain, organisatrice de voyages, et fan de chats entre autres choses.  En plus de ma famille et de ma ville,  j’aime les livres, les voyages, les musées, l’histoire, faire des critiques hypocrites sur la mode « people » et les biscuits.
 
Comme ma copine et voisine Nathalie, je voudrais que vous vous sentiez chez vous, à l’aise, cosy, et même inspiré(e) dans notre charmant studio.  En tant que passionnée de Paris, je serai toujours là si vous le souhaitez pour vous donner des suggestions sur quoi faire ou voir (que cela soit des « musts » ou des choses insolites), des supers restos ou magasins du quartier, etc.

Welcome to the community if you are a new comer on airbnb. 
I will be happy to welcome you in my place when you come to Paris.

I've been a host on airbnb since may 2013, and also a guest a couple of times. I deeply enjoy this new way to travel, to meet and share experiences. 
Hence my motto, welcome my guests as I would loved to be welcomed myself (when I’m travelling abroad). 
It never happened to me that way yet, but I do not despair ;0)

To tell you a few words  about myself, I’ve been living in this flat where I've spent the last 17 beautiful years. But I'm also spending some time in  the country side, on the lands of Marcel Proust (the famous French writer), an hour and a half away from Paris where I have my workshop.

After being for more than 12 years a fireworks display designer for one of the biggest French firm, I'm now still doing it as a freelancer, but most of all decided to focus on a more personal artistic expression and my love for drawing. 

I will always try to help you the best way I can to make you enjoy your stay in Paris! 

see you soon. 
Roman

Passionné par la vie en général, j'ai quand même quelques préférences, notamment pour le bricolage, les vieux vélos que je retape à neuf pour leur donner une nouvelle vie, les brocantes, la pelote basque... 
Les voyages sont avant tout des aventures humaines pour moi, et j'ai eu la chance de vivre de belles expériences en Amérique Latine, aux États-Unis, en Asie (Thaïlande), à Madagascar...

Cette année je vivrais avec le chat et peut être Xavier un amigo, nous n'imaginons pas vivre autrement que dans la rencontre et le partage, notre maison est avant tout un lieu ouvert, convivial et naturel. Une ambiance douce et détendue très précieuse dans la capitale... Pour ainsi dire nous avons le sens de l'accueil dans le sang et nous aimons ça !

As a freelance journalist, I am working from home. So I took a big care of making our house the most cosy and welcoming place as possible.

My husband Richard (43, copy editor) and I live in this apartment since 2010. 

We are used to swap and rent it.

We love our Belleville disctrict, wich is like a village in the city.
This is the perfect place to live with kids. 
The apartment is of course childproof (socket covers, gates to protect the stairways). 

A few of our favorites things ? 
- travelling (from the United States to China, Israël, Italy...)
- cooking for friends and discovering the best restaurants
- binge-watching TV shows...

We like to welcome warmly our guests. 
You will always find at your arrival a good map of Paris, all you need to know about the night and days facilities in the area and our favorites adresses.

Je suis donc parisienne depuis 8 ans et je travaille dans la communication.
J'adore sortir, flâner et me perdre dans les rues parisiennes que je découvre encore tous les jours.
Sportive, j'aime la plongée, les sports de glisse, le tennis et le running; j'ai d'ailleurs un petit parcours hebdomadaire qui me fait passer, par exemple, par le nouveau parc Clichy/Batignolles puis le fameux square des Batignolles pour finir la course parc Monceaux; avis aux voyageurs amateurs de running...une autre manière de découvrir Paris!

A native of Amiens (North of France, between Lille and Paris), I left at 18 to Paris to do my graduate studies, then I moved to Lille and Montpellier before leaving one year in the United States for my last year graduate studies in South Carolina and then for an internship in New York; to finally be back in Paris to settle down for a while.
So that I'm a Parisian since 8 years and I work in communication.
I love going out, hang out and get lost in the streets of Paris that I am still discovering every day.

I was born in Paris 38 years ago (not so easy to find a Paris native in Paris!) and grew up in a milieu where French art de vivre is key. 
I love Paris, where I have my habit but  where I always keep room for surprise. 
I’m the one, friends have always kept calling asking « where could I take my parents for dinner » « what would you suggest for an anniversary  », « It’s so sunny today, where can we have a brunch ?
Just  like you…
I love travelling, discovering new parts, going out to concerts, movies, exhibitions, partying or spending quiet times with family and friends by the fire place in a sunny park .
I love good food, good wine, and I feel truly sorry when I see disoriented tourists sitting in a tourist trap where I wouldn’t go even if paid.
I decided it was time ! 
After studying in HEC management school and working for 10 years in big advertising agencies, I left the top management position I had achieved, deciding  that it was time that I launched my own business, make something that I really liked. That's how I founded my own business, with this ambitious project of making you experience Paris like only a Parisian can. 
Looking forward to seeing you in Paris ! :)

It offers everything you really need to enjoy good vacations in Paris : good wifi, hot water, heaters, comfy beds, kitchen and balconies (to smoke cigarets or only watch the scenery of the ""Aristocats"" on the roofs of Paris).
I love to help my guests as you can read so many advises on my ad (and much more when you'll book!) as technical details about transportation and also the good places to eat/drink/visit/shop.
I would say that my place is perfect for the following type of guests :  Young or middle-age (couple(s), friends, colleagues, relatives) who are thirsty to visit the city all day long, come back home to relax on the balcony for sunset with a glass of fine wine, then crash on my comfy beds until the next morning to go walking along the river ’s shore (la Seine is only 10mn’s walk from my place).  You can start by Les Tuileries (the king's playground), Le Louvre's courtyard (pyramide), join Notre-Dame (the back view is the best!), follow the flow to Le Marais' fashion shops, then (for the most courageous) enjoy a night concert on a ""péniche"" boat and come back home riding a time-share bicycle (for the most inconscients if they survive the paris driving ;-)  But of course, if you are 60 year’s old willing to spend all day writing your script at home on an old typewriter like Woody Allen drinking sparkling mineral water, this is also allowed... Strange to me (specially about the mineral water) but allowed...  Welcome to the Old Good Paris ! :-)

Dans ma rue, si vous aimez la cuisine traditionnelle française, vous pourrez vous restaurer dans l'un des derniers vrais bistrots parisiens, le fameux restaurant gastronomique ""Chez Benoit"", repris par le grand chef Alain Ducasse. 
Ce restaurant, devenu une véritable institution, existe depuis 1912.

Plus branché : ""Le Georges"", un établissement tout en haut du centre Georges-Pompidou. Vous dînerez dans un décor raffiné et extrêmement moderne avec vue à couper le souffle sur  tout Paris. 

Plus cool, le ""Café Beaubourg"" en bas de la maison. C'est le lieu idéal 
pour prendre un petit déjeuner, un verre, un lunch et même dîner. C'est le rendez-vous chic des artistes branchés. Vous aurez la chance d'y croiser des personnalités.

Le Marais, est le seul quartier  de Paris ou l'on peut faire son shopping le dimanche dans les boutiques les plus branchées de la capitale. 
Les parisiens adorent s'y retrouver pour un brunch. La rue des Rosiers, est un lieu emblématique de la communauté juive, ou vous pourrez déguster leurs fameuses spécialités culinaires.

A l'heure du Tea time, je vous recommande le salon de thé ""Mariage Frères"". Maison de thé parisienne depuis 1854. Le décor est magnifique, le thé est raffiné et d'excellente qualité. 30 rue du bourg Tibourg Paris IVe

Découvrez le grand magasin préféré des parisiens, le mythique BHV Rivoli, ouvert tous les jours sauf le dimanche.

De chez moi, vous pourrez visiter Paris à pieds, L'Ile St Louis et Notre Dame; le quartier Latin ;

I thought I'd only be studying abroad for a semester, but now it's been over six years...

I absolutely adore Paris and I work for a tourism company so part of my job is learning more about it! There are some fascinating stories and legends (have you heard of the demonic doors of Notre Dame?!).

Sometimes I contemplate moving back to Chicago but then I think of baguettes and almond croissants, cheese shops, daily markets, museums, Sacre Coeur and the view over the city, walking in the parks and along the Seine... and I know my time here is not yet finished.

I haven't had as much of a chance to travel around Europe as some of my friends, though I have loved Brussels, Bruges, Amsterdam, Cadiz, London, Budapest... but for all of my long vacations I go back to Chicago to visit friends and family.","N/A","f",1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id']","t","f","75018",48.8937310211977,2.34695102893908,"t","Apartment","Entire home/apt",4,1,1,2,"Real Bed","{Wifi,Kitchen,""Smoking allowed"",""Pets live on this property"",Elevator,Heating,Washer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Private living room"",""Hot water"",""Bed linens"",Microwave,""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""BBQ grill"",""Patio or balcony"",""Long term stays allowed"",""Host greets you""}",410,"$53.00","$200.00","$10.00",2,"$0.00",3,30,"t",0,0,0,0,7,"2014-01-01","2017-12-29",100,10,10,10,10,9,10,"f","f","moderate","f","f",1,0.12,316.214634146341,0.0416
